iVal is a course-based instructor evaluation platfrom for University of Washington Information School (iSchool). 

This web application allows user to search for classes, rate instructors who have taught that class and find other people's comments on that instructor. When users search for specific class, he will see all the instructors who have taught that class listed. However, unlike other existing professorÔºçrating website which displays professor overall rating only, we rate instructors by classes they are teaching. For example, Professor A is teaching both Class 101 and Class 200, he will have two different ratings based on what class users are searching for. 

iVal also provides insert class/professor features. If you are unable to find a class and instructors you want to rate, please click on the 'Add a Class'/ 'Add a Professor' button on the top to send us a add class/professor request form. 

We appreciate and value diverisity. 
*Diversity is a core value and foundational concept in the Information School and also in iVal. We support minority communities by displaying diversity-related courses under the iSchool.
